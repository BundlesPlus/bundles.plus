# OSGi enRoute OAuth2 work

This is a project that is used to establish an OAuth2 API.

If you run the project you get a twitter 'search' command. You can provide the credentials by setting environment variables:

* `twitter.client.id`
* `twitter.client.secret`

(you can do this in Eclipse in the Debug Configuration.)
